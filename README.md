- **Program Reviews**: Students can also review entire programs, providing information on the curriculum, faculty, and career prospects.
- **Student Connections**: Connect with other students who are taking or have taken the same courses or programs.
- **Search and Filter**: Easily find reviews and connections by searching and filtering based on course names, program names, or keywords.

## Technologies Used

- **Swift**: The app is developed entirely in Swift, leveraging the powerful features of this language to create a smooth and responsive user experience.
